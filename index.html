<p align="justify">Hi! My name is Martin Kolarik and this is my personal portfolio and blog web. I am a machine learning researcher based in the enchanting city of Brno in the Czech Republic. You can find my portfolio & CV below. In the <a href="http://martinkolarik.com/menu/blog.html">blog</a> section I will describe some of our researches in simple human language and write about some non research projects I developed.<br> I am currently studying a Ph.D. programme in the university BUT in Brno in the field of machine learning and signal processing under associate professor doc. Ing. Radim Burget, PhD. I work as a research scientist on <a href="#researchexperience" title="Jump to: Research experiences section">projects</a> in applied and fundamental research. My <a href="#workexperience" title="Jump to: Work experiences section">work experiences</a> include both positions in corporate environment and startup companies. <br> I am passionate about new research approaches in the fields of machine learning and data science and I do my best to keep track of current state of the art. In my spare time I enjoy playing the guitar and riding & fixing my motorcycle. </p>
